Dataset Annotation
==================

Image annotations, in the context of object detection and segmentation, are metadata describing the localization and category of objects of interest.
Those can be represented by bounding boxes and object polygons (or sometimes pixel masks), respectively.
Annotated images are required for model training and evaluation since these require the presence of a so-called ground-truth, i.e., known bounding boxes or segmentations.
GinJinn2 supports the `PVOC <http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/>`_ and `COCO <https://cocodataset.org/#format-data>`_ image annotation formats.
Note that PVOC is only supported for bounding-box detection and some of the GinJinn2 utilities are restricted to use with COCO datasets.
Hence, we recommend preparing annotations in COCO format, if possible.

There are several freely available annotation tools, most of which support at least one of those formats.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of software for this purpose:

- `COCO Annotator <https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator>`_
- `CVAT <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat>`_
- `Labelbox <https://labelbox.com>`_
- `LabelImg <https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg>`_
- `VIA <https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/>`_

We recommend the use of `CVAT <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat>`_, since this software allows to export COCO annotations consistent with the COCO dataset specification and are compatible with many other tools working with COCO formatted datasets.
In addition, COCO datasets generated by GinJinn2â€™s predict command, can be imported by CVAT, for example, to perform manual corrections/refinement or to promote active learning.
Since CVAT supports several other popular annotation formats, it provides good interoperability with other tools, as well.

Annotation with CVAT
--------------------

To install CVAT please follow the `official installation guide <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/cvat/docs/administration/basics/installation/>`_.

The following video shows how to get from a folder with images to an annotated dataset ready to use with GinJinn2.
